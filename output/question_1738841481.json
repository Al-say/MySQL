    "question": "Which of the following SQL statements is used to retrieve all columns from a table named 'employees'?",
    "options": [
        "A. SELECT * FROM employees;",
        "B. SELECT ALL FROM employees;",
        "C. SELECT COLUMNS FROM employees;",
        "D. SELECT TABLE employees;"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct SQL statement to retrieve all columns from a table is 'SELECT * FROM table_name;'. The asterisk (*) is a wildcard that represents all columns in the table. Option B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not follow the correct SQL syntax for retrieving all columns from a table.",
